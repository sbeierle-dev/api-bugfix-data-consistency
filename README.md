# Python Bug Fixing & Debugging

This repository contains small, focused examples of Python bug fixing and debugging.

The goal is not to showcase frameworks or architectures, but to demonstrate a
practical approach to:
- understanding unfamiliar code
- identifying root causes of bugs
- applying minimal, targeted fixes
- improving stability without rewriting systems

The examples are intentionally simple and problem-focused.
They reflect real-world situations where existing code needs to be fixed,
not redesigned.

## Scope
- Logic bugs and edge cases
- Error handling issues
- Broken assumptions in existing code
- Small refactorings for stability and clarity

This repository is work-in-progress and will grow over time with additional cases.
